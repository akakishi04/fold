## Accepted V5-F chain

### C213 — memory operation contract

Scientific execution HEAD:
`f59f615b5d409400c9fc5247270a37960ffac197`

Summary SHA256:
`370ee39bcd32da4ce797ecfb21ce3b863013c788f6daaaf0fb9a10edac643b43`

Accepted claim:
ASSERT/REPLACE/RETRACT/ASSUME/END_SCOPE/QUERY semantics preserve factor identity, scope, revision and
provenance; hypotheses do not enter authoritative EvidenceState.

### C214 — memory capsule closure

Scientific execution HEAD:
`b4a020aeb006ec758e06ce1dc6d1b0ad5784e150`

Summary SHA256:
`bd7a310fc89873b4571d1748a96fa1a121d147a0617d48e2d8824d4769deb37d`

Accepted claim:
accepted C213 observed edits project into the existing fixed-port response capsule and match an
independent full-memory solve within the registered float64 tolerance. OUT_OF_SCOPE and
NUMERIC_UNSAFE remain distinct.

### C215 — H1/H2 chunk commit

Scientific execution HEAD:
`663f42ca21f977b6530e4df8709fc306c2ebd8c9`

Published log commit:
`36f5921677f274538d011c76ba34a77b8ed01ded`

Log SHA256:
`e894c0d10553c7877c410c963f0c75eb810518247f50fd7aa63ca2f8620c2d8e`

Summary SHA256:
`96b3e5b9cf465b9dea33920de095fc5d7d8e4c0cba960d64597c95fc15eda237`

Execution:
- focused regression **2149/2149**;
- source/artifact precheck PASS;
- protected inputs preserved;
- tracked tree clean;
- run_execution_valid True.

Deciding metrics:
-9 snapshots;
- status sequence:
  `SUPPORTED,HOT_REQUIRED,SUPPORTED,SUPPORTED,HOT_REQUIRED,SUPPORTED,SUPPORTED,SUPPORTED,SUPPORTED`;
- two chunk commits, both COMMITTED;
- semantic clocks unchanged across commit;
- commit readout deltas [0.0,0.0];
- final storage_epoch2;
- final semantic clocks memory6/evidence4/time3;
- final H2 factor beta only;
- operation-history entries0;
- capsule/full-reference max abs error `1.1102230246251565e-16` <= `1e-10`;
- OUT_OF_SCOPE and NUMERIC_UNSAFE controls preserved state and exposed no numeric value;
- learned Writer/Reader/Port Selector/Coverage classifier/model-forward calls0.

Accepted claim:
the deterministic H1/H2 chunk-commit boundary can move supported observed records from H1 into H2
without changing semantic clocks or readout, and committed-factor REPLACE/RETRACT can operate from
current protected-factor descriptors without replaying hidden operation history.

Non-claim:
C215 does not establish learned memory routing, natural-language memory extraction, compression
advantage, total memory-cost superiority, or Gate F.

Historical invalid C215 launcher-guard attempts are retained in:
`docs/experiment-ledger-addendum-c215-recovery.md`.

## C215 maintenance checkpoint

Maintenance working-tree prune commit:
`44075b22bfc619ba5cf14e4c1f2efd65fd7a5c46`

Post-prune accepted-source audit:
- C215 source pins checked: **122/122**
- missing source pins: **0**
- SHA mismatches: **0**

Harness before -> after:
- C-numbered invoke scripts: **27 -> 16**
- C-numbered run scripts: **73 -> 17**

Retained source-pinned harness:
- `tools/run_c171.ps1`
- `tools/run_c200.ps1` through `tools/run_c215.ps1`
- `tools/invoke_c200.ps1` through `tools/invoke_c215.ps1`
- shared `tools/invoke_active.ps1`
- shared `tools/publish_experiment_log.ps1`

Pruned historical harness remains recoverable from Git history.

Log retention after maintenance:
- compact `latest.json` receipts retained for **27/27** C189-C215 experiments;
- full resident logs retained only for C212 (Gate E decision) and C215 (latest checkpoint);
- resident full-log payload reduced from about **11.89 MiB** to about **1.35 MiB**;
- pruned full logs remain recoverable from Git history.

Maintenance policy:
- `tools/README-experiment-harness.md`
- `docs/experiment-run-logs/README.md`

This cleanup is not a history rewrite; old blobs still exist in Git history / pack storage.

## Current V5-F architecture boundary

Established, deterministic reference path:

```text
MemoryOp semantics
  -> H1 hot relational state
  -> fixed capability / relation-to-port mapping
  -> H2 response-capsule state
  -> SUPPORTED / HOT_REQUIRED / OUT_OF_SCOPE / NUMERIC_UNSAFE
  -> numeric readout
```

Still unestablished:
- learned Writer;
- learned Reader;
- learned Port Selector / Capsule Router;
- learned Coverage classifier;
- natural-language-to-memory operation mapping;
- end-to-end memory bytes/latency advantage versus full-history baseline;
- Gate F deciding holdout.

## Historical references

Detailed C-series history remains in:
- `docs/experiment-ledger-addendum-*.md`
- C215 recovery: `docs/experiment-ledger-addendum-c215-recovery.md`
- protocol: `docs/experiment-conversation-handoff-protocol.md`
- roadmap: `docs/development-roadmap-v0.5.md`

Pruned logs/scripts are recoverable with `git log --all -- <path>` and
`git show <commit>:<path>`.

## Next boundary

C216 is **not registered**.

The next V5-F experiment should introduce only one learned memory component at a time; do not mix
learned Writer, Reader, Port Selector, Coverage classifier and cost optimization in one C number.

Before registering C216, choose the single next scientific question and preregister its split,
training budget, baseline and interpretation boundary.

## Stop condition

Maintenance checkpoint is complete.

Do not treat C215 as Gate F completion. Gate F remains **NOT PASSED**.
